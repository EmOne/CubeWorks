Functionality:
	The Sun Sensor Driver uses the ADC Drivers already established SPi connection. (See ADC Driver) Using polymorphism this driver reads in from multiple channels of communication via the ADCâ€™s read() function. These channels are connected to the five Sun Sensors. The data collected from these sensors can be accessed by calling: sunSensorDriver.SunSensor.read()
