**********************************************************************************

#1 <Added DummySunSensor to preBoomDeploy> "flightLogic/missionModes/preBoomDeploy.py"
    Lines 8-9 & 92-95
    Testing is kind of the worst if we're relying on having to turn the lights
    off and on in the lab so adding this in makes testing more streamlined and repeatable.
    THIS MUST BE REMOVED BEFORE PUSHING TO MASTER

#2 <Rearranged getDriverData> "flightLogic/getDriverData.py"
    Throughtout 
    Moved variables up in code so that they are assigned before being called

#3 <Added try catch statement to the pi camera in boomDeploy> "flightLogic/missionModes/boomDeploy.py"
    Lines 36-39
    We added a try catch statement so that the flight logic would move past preBoomDeploy into postBoomDeploy

#4 <Added try catch statement to python.interrupt> "TXISR/pythonInterrupt.py"
    Lines 20-24, 30-54
    The try catch was added to make the system continue past preBoomDeploy

#5 <Added code to index the data file> "TXISR/prepareFiles.py"
    Lines 18, 72-137
    Added a new argument to the function prepare data that corresponds to the
    line to start at, -1 starts the function from the last transmission.
    Used the function linechache.getline() to allow the data from the data file
    to be indexed.

#6 <Updated filepaths to work for new install process> Throughtout
    Hard coded all file paths to go to /home/pi/TXISRData or /home/pi/flightLogicData

#7 <Debugging TXServiceCode> "TXISR/TXServiceCode/TXServiceCode.c"
    Lines 19-20, 206-241, 357-375
    19-20 Fixed file paths
    206-241 Added variable char chl to temporarily store the value of the lower
        byte for the hex data so it can be used to find the end of a line.
        Split the loops pulling the timestamp and data into different loops so
        they would stopp tripping over each other as much.
    357-375 Changed 0-9 from their ascii decimal values to their character
        representation to remove confusion.
