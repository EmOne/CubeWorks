**********************************************************************************

#1 <Added DummySunSensor to preBoomDeploy> "flightLogic/missionModes/preBoomDeploy.py"
    Lines 8-9 & 92-95
    Testing is kind of the worst if we're relying on having to turn the lights
    off and on in the lab so adding this in makes testing more streamlined and repeatable.
    THIS MUST BE REMOVED BEFORE PUSHING TO MASTER

#2 <Rearranged getDriverData> "flightLogic/getDriverData.py"
    Throughtout 
    Moved variables up in code so that they are assigned before being called

#3 <Added try catch statement to the pi camera in boomDeploy> "flightLogic/missionModes/boomDeploy.py"
    Lines 36-39
    We added a try catch statement so that the flight logic would move past preBoomDeploy into postBoomDeploy

#4 <Added try catch statement to python.interrupt> "TXISR/pythonInterrupt.py"
    Lines 20-24, 30-54
    The try catch was added to make the system continue past preBoomDeploy


#5 <Added code to index the data file> "TXISR/prepareFiles.py"
    Lines 18, 72-137
    Added a new argument to the function prepare data that corresponds to the
    line to start at, -1 starts the function from the last transmission.
    Used the function linechache.getline() to allow the data from the data file
    to be indexed.

#6 <Updated filepaths to work for new install process> Throughtout
    Hard coded all file paths to go to /home/pi/TXISRData or /home/pi/flightLogicData

#7 <Debugging TXServiceCode> "TXISR/TXServiceCode/TXServiceCode.c"
    Lines 19-20, 206-241, 357-375
    19-20 Fixed file paths
    206-241 Added variable char chl to temporarily store the value of the lower
        byte for the hex data so it can be used to find the end of a line.
        Split the loops pulling the timestamp and data into different loops so
        they would stopp tripping over each other as much.
    357-375 Changed 0-9 from their ascii decimal values to their character
        representation to remove confusion.

#8 <Changed startFromBeginning to boolean> "TXISR/prepareFiles.py flightLogic/missionModes/postBoomDeploy.py"
    Changed startFromBeginning to boolean to decrease margin of error

#9 <Started writing the index to txWindows.txt> "TXISR/packetProcessing.py"
    Line 180
    We needed to know what line to write to so when it gets sent up with all of
    the transmission data it gets saved to do the windows file.

#10 <Added haslib.md5 to hmac> "TXISR/packetProcessing" "GroundStation/transmissionHandling.py"
    Packet processing lines 17, 74, 96
    transmissionHandling lines 4, 93
    In python 3.8 they made it a requirement for hmac to have three parameters
    so a thid parameter was added to run the kind of encryption that was already
    being run before

#11 <Added indexing command> "TXISR/prepareFiles.py TXISR/packetProcessing.py GroundStation/transmissionHandling.py"
    Prepare files lines 77-78
    Packet processing lines 62-67
    transmissionHandling lines 43-44, 77-83
    Added 34 bytes to the tx window packet that corresponds to the line number
        to be indexed to. In transmissionHandling a new int34tohex function was
        also added.

#12 <Added logic for the running transmission c code> "flightLogic/missionModes/postBoomDeploy", "flightLogic/mainFlightlogic.py"
    mainFlightlogic: Lines 39-40, postBoomDeploy: Line 20, 24, 76, 79
    

#13 <Added the ability to skip staright to postBoomDeploy>
    "TXISR/packetProcessing.py" Lines: 21, 156-162, 253-254
        Added two bytes to the command packet so that there's an option to skip
        to post boom deploy.
    "GroundStation/transmissionHandling.py" Lines: 56, 62
        Creates the extra two bytes to skip to postBoomDeploy.
    "flightLogic/missionModes/preBoomDeploy.py" Lines: 57-59, 164-170
        Added a function to cancel all tasks and end the function so that the
        program can skip to postBoomDeploy.
    "flightLogic/missionModes/antennaDeploy.py" Lines: 40, 43-44, 56-57, 63-64, 113-119
        Added a function to cancel all tasks and end the function so that the
        program can skip to postBoomDeploy.
    "flightLogic/missionModes/boomDeploy.py" Lines: 32, 36-37, 43-44, 61-67
        Added a function to cancel all tasks and end the function so that the
        program can skip to postBoomDeploy.
    "flightLogic/mainFlightlogic.py" Lines: 16, 76-78, 106-108
        Added if statements that set lastMode to 4 to skip to post boom deploy

#14 <Allowed all mission modes to transmit>
    "flightLogic/missionModes/antennaDeploy.py" Lines: 14, 16, 31, 41, 74-104, 121-156
        Copied the code from postBoomDeploy into a function called transmit and
        also copied the function readNextTransferWindow in to make sure it would work.
    "flightLogic/missionModes/preBoomDeploy.py" Lines: 54, 172-240
        Copied the code from postBoomDeploy into a function called transmit and
        also copied the function readNextTransferWindow in to make sure it would work.
    "flightLogic/missionModes/boomDeploy.py" Lines: 33, 69-136
        Copied the code from postBoomDeploy into a function called transmit and
        also copied the function readNextTransferWindow in to make sure it would work.

#15 <Removing startFromBeginning from the code>
    "TXISR/packetProcessing.py" Through out
        Removed the startFromBeginning variable from the txWindows packet because 
        the index already can do that.

#16 <Fixing the readNextTransferWindow loop>
    "flightLogic/missionModes/all
        There was a dumb list that was being initialized as a 0 and after 2
        hours of looking we finally found it and changed it, ugh

#17 <Changing how the c code gets called>
    "flightLogic/missionModes/all"
        Changed it from opening using popen to opening with os.system as well
        as adding a list with file paths so that the c code can be opened from root.

#18 <Created new class Transmitting> "flightLogic/transmitting.py"
    Lines: 0-90
    To avoid redundant code the Transmitting class was created in the file
        transmitting.py. The run function from postBoomDeploy was copied as
        transmit and the readNextTransferWindow was copied in with a small
        change to how it received the txWindows filepath.

#19 <Called the functions from Transmitting in each mission mode>
    "flightLogic/mainFlightlogic.py" Lines: 51, 63-66
        To minimize the number of times that a Transmitting object is created,
        a transmitObject is created in mainFlightlogic and then passed to
        each mission mode.
    "flightLogic/missionModes/antennaDeploy.py" Lines: 17, 27, 37-38
    "flightLogic/missionModes/preBoomDeploy.py" Lines: 25, 41, 50-51
    "flightLogic/missionModes/boomDeploy.py" Lines: 12, 19, 29-30
    "flightLogic/missionModes/postBoomDeploy.py" Lines: 12-13, 18, 28, 30, 35
        All traces of the redundant transmission code were removed and two async
        tasks were created to call the transmit and readNextTransferWindow functions

#20 <Created setNewTXWindow.c> "setNewTXWindow.c"
    Created a program that quickly and easily sets up a new window

#21 <Created transmition Queue> "TXISR/transmitionQueue.py"
    Created a new program that turns txWindows.txt into a min queue.

#22 <Implementing transmition Queue> 
    "TXISR/packetProcessing.py" Lines: 222-225
        Replaced the writing code with a line that prepares a window packet and
        then uses transmition queue to add it to the queue.
    "flightLogic/missionModes/transmitting.py" Lines: 42-50
        Implemented the transmition queue. First it pops off all old timestamps.
        Then it tracks time till next window by reading the timestamp of the
        next available element. 20 seconds before the window is open the entire
        line is pulled and processed as normal.

#23 <Added AX25 packet> "TXISR/packetProcessing.py" Lines: 30-61, 119-122
    Gave packet processing the ability to process an AX25 packet and
    immediately spit it back out.

#24 <Updated TXServiceCode to skip lines and deal with \n>
    "TXISR/TXServiceCode/TXServiceCode.c" Lines 235-253, 417
    Changed the program to return -1 if it's a bad character and then to skip
    the entire line rather than just the single character. Additionally added
    a break statement to allow it to better handle new line characters.

#25 <Made packetProcessing a class> "TXISR/packetProcessing.py" Throughout
    Took the collection of functions and put them into a class so that we could
    keep some of the variables across all of the functions.

#25 <Added skip to packetProcessing> "TXISR/packetPRocessing.py" Lines 322-332
    Adjusted packetProcessing so that if it receives skip to post boom, it will
    change the boot records to 4. The skip function checks this to see if the
    boot records are at 4. This has been implemented into each mission mode
    as a test on when to cancel all tasks and end the mission mode.

#26 <Added txWindow checking to fileProtection> 
    "protectionProticol.fileProtection.py" Lines 115-172
        To ensure that no bad windows get sent this was written to identify
        and remove bad windows.

    "TXISR/transmissionQueue.py" Lines 14, 28, 47, 64
        Implementing the window protection.
