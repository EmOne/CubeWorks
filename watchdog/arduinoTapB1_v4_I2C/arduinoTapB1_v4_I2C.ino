//This is the latest addition of the watchdog code, it only has the build-in heart beet nothing else.
//beetle doesn't work well with the watchdog protocol. To be specific, the watchdog doesn't work 
//well with the beetle's boot loader. It will cause an infinite loop. The best way around this 
//is to disable the watchdog for the void setup function and then use it within the void loop. 
//This is the main difference between the adruinoTap2 and this program the adriunoTapb1_finial.
