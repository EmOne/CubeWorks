#This are the classes that handle saving the data to the files
#####################################################################
#Each class has one func that will write all the data in a list that
#is passed to it.
#They are written as different classes so that each code my be quicker
#NOTE: try to only instantiate the classes once. if you have to do
#more this will not cause a  problem it will only slow the code 
#down.
